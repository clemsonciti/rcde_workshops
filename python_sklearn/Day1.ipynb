    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a powerful tool for making sense of large datasets. In this workshop, we will introduce the basics of machine learning using Python. We will emphasize the use of Clemson's Palmetto Cluster for running machine learning algorithms on large datasets. We will cover the following topics:\n",
    "* What is machine learning?\n",
    "* What are some of the python tools that facilitate machine learning?\n",
    "* What are the different types of machine learning?\n",
    "* What are some of the common machine learning algorithms?\n",
    "* How do we evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms?\n",
    "* How do we explore and clean data?\n",
    "* How do we prepare data for machine learning?\n",
    "* How do we make use of Clemson's Palmetto Cluster to efficiently run our machine learning code?\n",
    "* How can we run code that is too complex, or use data that is too large, for a Jupyter notebook?\n",
    "* What sorts of Palmetto resources should we request to allocate for our machine learning jobs?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Getting started\n",
    "You can download this notebook and its contents as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the terminal, run the following command: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clemsonciti/rcde_workshops/master/python_sklearn/download.sh`\n",
    "\n",
    "This copies to your drivespace a script that, when run, will copy the full workshop files to your drivespace. So now that you have that script, run the command: `bash download.sh`. You should now have a folder, `python_sklearn`, which contains this notebook and the rest of the workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run most of this notebook using the default kernel, though some of the code cells will only run if you have created an environment with specialized libraries installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "People use the term \"machine learning\" in a variety of ways. Some people use it more or less synonymously with \"artificial intelligence.\" And these days, AI does indeed usually work under the paradigm of machine learning. But \"machine learning\" refers to the use of algorithms to learn from data. The contrast here is with traditional programming, where a programmer writes code that tells the computer exactly what to do. In machine learning, the programmer writes code that tells the computer how to learn from data to make decisions.\n",

The dataset contains 581,012 samples and 54 features. The data contains binary (0 or 1) columns of data for qualitative independent variables (wilderness areas and soil types). The goal is to predict the forest cover type based on the cartographic features provided. "
