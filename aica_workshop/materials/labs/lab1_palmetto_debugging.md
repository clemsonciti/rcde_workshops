# Lab 1: Debugging failed jobs on Palmetto with Codex CLI

## Goals
- TODO: Define what "failed job" looks like (exit codes, stderr, scheduler state).
- TODO: Identify where logs live and how to retrieve them quickly.

## Setup
- TODO: Confirm SSH access and modules/environment basics.
- TODO: Create or provide a deliberately failing job script.

## Reproduce a failure
- TODO: Submit job, capture job id, and wait for failure.
- TODO: Collect stdout/stderr and scheduler metadata.

## Diagnose with Codex CLI
- TODO: Paste key log snippets and ask for root-cause hypotheses.
- TODO: Ask for minimal repro + targeted fix suggestions.
- TODO: Ask for "what evidence would confirm this?" prompts.

## Fix + validate
- TODO: Apply fix; re-run; confirm success.
- TODO: Record a short checklist for future incidents.

## Common failure modes (starter list)
- TODO: Missing module / wrong Python / bad env activation.
- TODO: Wrong paths / permissions / missing input files.
- TODO: OOM / time limit / wrong partition / oversubscription.
