# Lab 3: Resource efficiency & performance

## Goals
- TODO: Compare baseline runtime vs improved approaches.
- TODO: Practice prompts that target performance responsibly.

## Baseline measurement
- TODO: Run `scripts/run_sim.py` with increasing `--n-samples`.
- TODO: Record elapsed times and any CPU constraints.

## Prompting patterns (performance)
- TODO: "Profile first" prompts (what to measure; where time goes).
- TODO: "Constraints" prompts (no deps, stdlib only, clarity preserved).
- TODO: "Scale safely" prompts (avoid runaway samples; respect HPC policy).

## Improvement ideas (choose 1-2)
- TODO: Vectorization discussion (why NumPy would help; not used here).
- TODO: Parallelism discussion (multiprocessing; overhead vs benefit).
- TODO: RNG and loop micro-optimizations (readability tradeoffs).

## Wrap-up
- TODO: Summarize what improved and why.
- TODO: Note risks: over-parallelization, memory blowups, noisy benchmarks.
