# AI Code Assistants for Palmetto (3-hour workshop)

This repo is a minimal, runnable skeleton for the workshop labs and materials.
The detailed outline/agenda lives elsewhere; this repo keeps hands-on assets small.
Start here: `materials/` for slides, labs, and facilitator/admin notes.
Code example: `mc_sim/` + `scripts/run_sim.py`.
