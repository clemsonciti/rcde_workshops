# Introduction to C

## 1. What is C?     

```{dropdown}

- Developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs
- First public released in 1972. 
- **The** book: *The C programming languange" by Dennis M. Ritchie and Brian W. Kernighan. 
Prentice Hall 1988. 

:::{dropdown} How to learn C (now that you already know Java)? 

- [C for Java programmers](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/ferguson/csc/c/c-for-java-programmers.pdf)
- [C programming vs. Java programming](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/faq/c2java.html)

:::

:::{dropdown} Scary stuff ahead ...
 
- C is much less supportive for programmers than Java.
- (Much) easier to make mistake, and (much) harder to fix. 

:::


:::{dropdown} But it is exciting ...     
 
- C requires less memory resources than Java.
- C, in many instances, runs faster than Java. 
- Knowing C will make you a better programmer overall. 

:::

:::{dropdown} Similarities (or mostly similar) between C and Java     
 
- Values, types, literals, expressions
- Variables
- Control flow (if, switch, while, for, do-while)
- Call-return: parameters, arguments, return values
- Arrays (mostly)
- Primitive and reference types
- Type casting. 
- Library usage. 

:::

```

## 2. Differences between C and Java    

```{dropdown}
 
- C has no classes or objects (but something similar)
- C is not object-oriented. 
- C arrays are simpler:
  - No boundary checking. 
  - No knowledge of array's own size. 
- String operations are limited. 
- No collections, exceptions, or generics. 
- No automatic memory management. 
- **Pointers!!!**

## 3. Hands-on: Getting started
```{dropdown}

- SSH to `molly`. Refer to the Setup page if you need a refresher on how to 
do so.
- Change into `csc231` from inside your home directory. 
  - Your home directory is represented by the `~` sign. 
- Create a directory named `intro-c` inside `csc231`, 
then change into that directory.

~~~
$ cd ~/csc231
$ pwd
$ mkdir intro-c
$ ls
$ cd intro-c
$ pwd
~~~

::::{dropdown} Hands-on: Create hello.c

- Inside the terminal, make sure that you are still inside
`intro-c`, then use `nano` to create `hello.c`with the source code below. 

~~~
$ pwd
$ nano -l hello.c
~~~

<script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/d1e9336a82632c528ea797210ed0f553.js?file=hello.c"></script>

- Once finished editing in `nano`:
  - first hit `Ctrl-X` (same for both Windows and Mac). 
  - Next hit `Y` to save modified buffer (new contents). 
  - Hit `Enter` to save to the same file name as what you opened with. 
- **Memorize your key-combos!**.

:::{dropdown} What's in the code?

- Line 1: Standard C library for I/O, similar to Java's `import`.
- Line 2-4: Function declaration/definition for `main`:
  - Line 2: 
    - return type: `int`
    - function name: `main`
    - parameter list: 
       - `argc`: number of command line arguments.
       - `*argv[]`: pointers to array of command line argument strings. 
   - Line 3: Invoke builtin function `printf` to print out  string `Hello world!`
   with an end-of-line character `\n`. This is similar to `System.out.printf`.
   - Line 4: Exit a successfully executed program with a return value of 0.

::::{dropdown} Hands-on: Simple compile and run

- Similar to `javac`, we use `gcc` to compile C code. 
- Before compile, make sure that you are still inside `intro-c` in the terminal.

## 4. Challenge: 
```{dropdown}

The usage of C's `printf` is similar to Java's `System.out.printf`. Find out how to 
modify `hello.c` so that the program prints out `Hello Golden Rams!` with each word
on a single line. The program should use exactly one `printf` statement.

## 5. Variables, addresses, and pointers
```{dropdown}

- In Java, you can manipulate the value of a variable via the program but not directly 
in memory (inside the JVM). 
- In C, you can retrieve the address of the location in memory where the variable is 
stored. 
- The operator `&` (reference of) represents the memory address of a variable.



::::{dropdown} Hands-on: Pointer

- Inside the terminal, make suse that you are still inside
`intro-c`, then use `nano` to create `pointer-1.c`with the source code below. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/d1e9336a82632c528ea797210ed0f553.js?file=pointer-1.c"></script>

- `%p` is an output conversion syntax (similar to Java specifiers) for displaying memory 
address in hex format. See [Other Output Conversions](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Other-Output-Conversions.html#Other-Output-Conversions) for more 
details.
- Compile and run `pointer-1.c`

~~~
$ ls
$ gcc -o pointer-1 pointer-1.c
$ ./pointer-1
~~~

::::

:::{dropdown} Pointer Definition

- Pointer is a variable that points to a memory location (contains a memory location).  
  - We can them *pointer variables*. 
- A pointer is denoted by a `*` character. 
- The type of pointer must be the same as that of the value being stored in 
the memory location (that the pointer points to).
- If a pointer points to a memory location, how do we get these locations?
  - An `&` character in front of a variable (includes pointer variables) denotes that
  variable's address location. 

:::

::::{dropdown} Hands-on: Pointer and Variable's Addresses

- Inside the terminal, make suse that you are still inside
`intro-c`, then use `nano` to create `pointer-2.c`with the source code below. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/d1e9336a82632c528ea797210ed0f553.js?file=pointer-2.c"></script>

- Since `p_i` is a pointer variable, `p_i` contains a memory address (hence `%p`).
- Then, `*p_i` will point to **the value in the memory address contained in p_i**. 
  - This is referred to as *de-referencing*. 
  - This is also why the type of a pointer variable must match the type of data stored
  in the memory address the pointer variable contains. 
- Compile and run `pointer-2.c`

## 6. Pointers and memory allocation
```{dropdown}

- How does C request dynamic memory when you don't know at 
compile-time exactly what you will need?
- How does C allocate memory?
  - Automatic: compile arranges for memory to be allocated 
  and initialized for local variables when it is in scope.
  - Static: memory for static variables are allocated once 
  when program starts.
  - Dynamic: memory is allocated on the fly as needed.

::::{dropdown} Dynamic memory allocation

- Unlike Java, you have to do everything!
  - Ask for memory.
  - Return memory when you are done (garbage collection!).
- C function: [`malloc`](https://linux.die.net/man/3/malloc)
  - `void *malloc(size_t size);`
  - The `malloc()` function allocates `size` bytes and returns 
  a pointer to the allocated memory. The memory is **not initialized**. 
  If size is 0, then `malloc()` returns either `NULL`, or a unique 
  pointer value that can later be successfully passed to `free()`.
- C function: [`free`](https://linux.die.net/man/3/free)
  - void free(void *ptr);
  - The `free()` function frees the memory space pointed to by ptr, 
  which must have been returned by a previous call to `malloc()`, 
  `calloc()` or `realloc()`. Otherwise, or if `free(ptr)` has already 
  been called before, undefined behavior occurs. If `ptr` is `NULL`, 
  no operation is performed.

::::


::::{dropdown} Void pointer

- When `malloc` allocates memory, it returns a sequence of bytes, with
no predefined types. 
- A pointer that points to this sequence of bytes (the address of the 
starting byte), is called a **void pointer**.  
- A void pointer will then be typecast to an appropriate type. 

::::

::::{dropdown} Hands-on: malloc and type cast

- Inside the terminal, make suse that you are still inside
`intro-c`, then use `nano` to create `malloc-1.c`with the source code below. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/d1e9336a82632c528ea797210ed0f553.js?file=malloc-1.c"></script>

- What points to where:
  - `void *p = malloc(4);`: allocate 4 contiguous bytes. The address of the
  first byte is returned and assign to pointer variable `p`. `p` has no 
  type, so it is a `void pointer`. 
  - `int *ip = (int *)p;`: The address value *pointed to* by `p` is assigned
  to pointer variable `ip`. The bytes pointed to be `p` are now casted to 
  type `int`. 
- Compile and run `malloc-1.c`
