    "## 1.1 What is RAG and Why Do We Need It?\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines a pretrained large language model (LLM) with an external data retrieval system so that answers are **grounded in up-to-date, relevant external knowledge**. Instead of relying solely on what the LLM knows, RAG-enabled systems can \"consult\" databases or document corpora to generate better, more trustworthy responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivations for RAG in Research\n",
    "- **Reduce hallucinations**: LLMs sometimes make up answers. RAG anchors model outputs using real documents.\n",
    "- **Extend knowledge**: LLMs have a training cutoff; RAG lets you search new/specialized info on demand.\n",
    "- **Enable citations & trust**: In research and academic settings, RAG allows citation of sources and provenance.\n",
    "- **Lower costs**: Augmenting a frozen LLM with retrieval is much cheaper than fine-tuning or retraining.\n",

    "- **Open-domain QA**: e.g., \"What were the results of the latest climate impact study?\" Without RAG, LLM can't recall something recent; with RAG, it summarizes/quotes the real paper.\n",
    "- **Academic/enterprise chatbots**: e.g., University chatbot using RAG to cite research articles, theses, policies.\n",
    "- **LLM as a \"clerk\"**: LLM interprets, but retrieval provides the vital supporting facts/documents.\n",

    "## 1.3 RAG vs. Other Approaches\n",
    "- **Versus Fine-tuning:** Fine-tuning builds new knowledge into the model weights (very costly/slow). RAG keeps the model fixed and only augments its inputs with up-to-date evidence.\n",
    "- **Versus traditional search:** Search finds docs, but RAG finds *and reads/summarizes* them for you, so you get the answer directly.\n",
