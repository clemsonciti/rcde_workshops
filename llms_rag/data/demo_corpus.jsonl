Investigating Self-Feedback for Retrieval Augmented Generation at BioASQ 2025", "abstract": "Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs) iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types (yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these search systems.", "authors": ["Samy Ateia", "Udo Kruschwitz"], "year": 2025, "topics": ["NLP", "Retrieval", "Language Model", "Biomedical"], "categories": ["cs.CL"], "source_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05366v1"}

Identifying an optimal reaction coordinate (RC) that accurately captures the progress of these dynamics is crucial for understanding and simulating such processes. This work introduces a nonparametric RC optimization framework that incorporates trajectory histories, enabling robust analysis even for irregular or incomplete data. The power of the method is demonstrated through increasingly challenging analyses of protein folding dynamics, where it provides accurate committor estimates that pass a stringent validation test and yield high-resolution free energy profiles. Its generality is further illustrated through applications to dynamics in phase space, a conceptual ocean circulation model, and a longitudinal clinical dataset. These results demonstrate that rare event dynamics can be accurately characterized without exhaustive sampling of the configuration space, establishing a general, flexible, and robust framework for analyzing complex dynamical systems and longitudinal datasets.", "authors": ["Polina V.

Traditional topic modeling techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), provide valuable insights but are computationally expensive, making them impractical for real-time data analysis. Although recent advances in distributed training and fast sampling methods have improved efficiency, real-time topic exploration remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present MLego, an interactive query framework designed to support real-time topic modeling analysis by leveraging model materialization and reuse. Instead of retraining models from scratch, MLego efficiently merges materialized topic models to construct approximate results at interactive speeds. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce a hierarchical plan search strategy for single queries and an optimized query reordering technique for batch queries. We integrate MLego into a visual analytics prototype system, enabling users to explore large-scale textual datasets through interactive queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLego significantly reduces computation costs while maintaining high-quality topic modeling results. MLego enhances existing visual analytics approaches, which primarily focus on user-driven topic modeling, by enabling real-time, query-driven exploration.

Here, we introduce a data-driven framework based on generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion for the inverse design of high-performance SMAs. By coupling a pretrained GAN with a property prediction model, we perform gradient-based latent space optimization to directly generate candidate alloy compositions and processing parameters that satisfy user-defined property targets. The framework is experimentally validated through the synthesis and characterization of five NiTi-based SMAs. Among them, the Ni$_{49.8}$Ti$_{26.4}$Hf$_{18.6}$Zr$_{5.2}$ alloy achieves a high transformation temperature of 404 $^\\circ$C, a large mechanical work output of 9.9 J/cm$^3$, a transformation enthalpy of 43 J/g , and a thermal hysteresis of 29 {\\deg}C, outperforming existing NiTi alloys. The enhanced performance is attributed to a pronounced transformation volume change and a finely dispersed of Ti$_2$Ni-type precipitates, enabled by sluggish Zr and Hf diffusion, and semi-coherent interfaces with localized strain fields.

By incorporating only a few input-output examples into prompts, LLMs can rapidly perform these new tasks. While the impact of these demonstrations on LLM performance has been extensively studied, most existing approaches prioritize representativeness over diversity when selecting examples from large corpora. To address this gap, we propose Dual-Div, a diversity-enhanced data-efficient framework for demonstration selection in biomedical ICL. Dual-Div employs a two-stage retrieval and ranking process: First, it identifies a limited set of candidate examples from a corpus by optimizing both representativeness and diversity (with optional annotation for unlabeled data). Second, it ranks these candidates against test queries to select the most relevant and non-redundant demonstrations. Evaluated on three biomedical NLP tasks (named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE), and text classification (TC)) using LLaMA 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 for inference, along with three retrievers (BGE-Large, BMRetriever, MedCPT), Dual-Div consistently outperforms baselines-achieving up to 5% higher macro-F1 scores-while demonstrating robustness to prompt permutations and class imbalance.

To address this, we propose an air quality PM2.5 index prediction model based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture. The model effectively combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for local spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling temporal dependencies in time series data. Using a multivariate dataset collected from an industrial area in Beijing between 2010 and 2015 -- which includes hourly records of PM2.5 concentration, temperature, dew point, pressure, wind direction, wind speed, and precipitation -- the model predicts the average PM2.5 concentration over 6-hour intervals. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.236, outperforming traditional time series models in both accuracy and generalization. This demonstrates its strong potential in real-world applications such as air pollution early warning systems.

Machine learning interatomic potentials, trained on data from first-principles calculations, offer a powerful alternative by efficiently approximating the complex three-dimensional potential energy surface with near-DFT accuracy. In this work, we develop a general-purpose machine learning interatomic potential for amorphous alloys by using a dataset comprising 20400 configurations across representative binary and ternary amorphous alloys systems. The model demonstrates excellent predictive performance on an independent test set, with a mean absolute error of 5.06 meV/atom for energy and 128.51 meV/\\r{A} for forces. Through extensive validation, the model is shown to reliably capture the trends in macroscopic property variations such as density, Young's modulus and glass transition temperature across both the original training systems and the compositionally modified systems derived from them. It can be directly applied to composition-property mapping of amorphous alloys. Furthermore, the developed interatomic potential enables access to the atomic structures of amorphous alloys, allowing for microscopic analysis and interpretation of experimental results, particularly those deviating from empirical trends.This work breaks the long-standing computational bottleneck in amorphous alloys research by developing the first general-purpose machine learning interatomic potential for amorphous alloy systems.
