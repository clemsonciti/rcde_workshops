## Description
This 2-part workshop series introduces students to the essential concepts in deep learning and walks through the common steps in a deep learning workflow from data loading to training and evaluation. Throughout the sessions, students will participate in writing and executing simple deep learning programs using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) â€“ a popular Python library for developing, training, and deploying deep learning models.

## Course outline:
* Conceptual Introduction to Deep Learning
* Using Pytorch on the Palmetto Cluster
* Introduction to the Pytorch Library
	- Tensors, Parameters, Modules
	- Computing on GPU
	- Datasets and Data loading
	- Custom models
	- Training and evaluation
* Worked Deep Learning Example

## Prerequisites
All students should have a Palmetto Cluster account. If you do not already have an account, you can [request one here](https://docs.rcd.clemson.edu/palmetto/starting/#-new-user-procedure). Students should be familiar with the Python programming language. This requirement could be fulfilled by personal projects, coursework, or completion of the [Introduction to Python Programming](../python_programming/00-index.md) workshop series. Experience in numeric computing with the `numpy` library is helpful but not required.
