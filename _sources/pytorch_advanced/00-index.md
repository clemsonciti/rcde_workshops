## Workshop Description
Welcome to the advanced pytorch workshop series. In this series we will start with a simple deep learning example and then iteratively add in more advanced approaches and tooling. We will work through the following techniques: 
* Downloading and fine-tuning pre-trained models
* Script-based development workflow
* Organizing model code with [Pytorch Ligtning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/index.html)
    * Checkpointing
* Experiment tracking with [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site)
* Using multiple-GPUs
    * Using pytorch syntax
    * In Pytorch Lightning
    * Profiling GPU usage
* Reproducible research with Pytorch
    * Version control
    * Setting random seeds
    * Logging results
* Hyperparameter tuning
    * Bash scripting
    * Using Sweeps

## Prerequisites
All students should have a Palmetto Cluster account. If you do not already have an account, you can visit our [getting started page](https://docs.rcd.clemson.edu/palmetto/starting). Students must have basic familiarity with Python programming and a good grasp of Pytorch fundamentals. This requirement is satisified by taking the the [introductory pytorch series](https://clemsonciti.github.io/rcde_workshops/pytorch/00-index.html) or other experience using Pytorch.
