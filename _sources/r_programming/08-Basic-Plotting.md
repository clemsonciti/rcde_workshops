## Course content:
- Making exploratory graphs
- Principles of analytic graphics
- Plotting systems and graphics devices in R
- The base, lattice, and ggplot2 plotting systems in R

## Exploratory graph
### Why do we use graphs in data analysis?
- To understand data properties
- To find patterns in data
- To suggest modeling strategies
- To "debug" analyses
- To communicate results

## Ploting System
There are 3 main plotting systems in R:
### The Base plotting system
```
- Start with blank plot and build up the plot
- Plot is just a series of R command
- Flexible
```
###  The Lattice plotting system (using package::lattice)
```
- Plots created using single function call
- Good for putting many plots to screen
- Cannot add to plots once created
```

### The ggplot plotting system (using package::ggplot2)
```
- Similar to Lattice but easier
- Many default mode
- Flexible between Base and Lattice
```

R is a data analysis language, so naturally it comes with many built-in functions for plotting. Let's look at some of them, in application to the `mtcars` datast.

```r
data(mtcars)
dim(mtcars)
names(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
print(mtcars)
```

First, let's make a bar plot of the miles-per-gallon values of the 32 cars. `col` specifies the colour.
```r
barplot(mtcars$mpg, col="green")
```

Now, let's make a histogram for horsepower values.
```r
hist(mtcars$hp, col="magenta")
```
Let's display two jistorgrams on the same plot. We'll use the function `par` to specify that the two histograms will be plotted stacked to each other, one on the left and one on the right. 

```r
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(mtcars$mpg,col="blue")
hist(mtcars$wt,col="blue")
```

Let's create a box plot for miles-per-gallon data. We'll have to reset the plot options to let R know we don't use multiple plots anymore; this is done with `dev.off()`.

```r
dev.off()
boxplot(mtcars$mpg,col="blue",main="Boxplot for mpg")
```

Now, let's make this box plot for every value of cylinders (`mtars$cyl`). We will use the same function `boxplot`, but with a few more parameters. We will specify the data explicitly, as well as `col` (for colour scheme), `main` (main figure title), `xlab` and `ylab` (X- and Y-axis labels). We will use the function `legend` to create a legend. We call `factors` to find out the unique cylinder values.

```r
factor(mtcars$cyl)
boxplot(mpg~cyl,data=mtcars,
        col=terrain.colors(3),main="MPG by car cylinders",
        xlab = "cylinders",ylab="mpg")
legend("topright",c("4","6","8"),fill = terrain.colors(3))
```

And a scatter plot. We'll use the `plot` function for this purpose. The dots will be coloured according to the number of cylinders.
```r
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt, main="Car Fuel vs Weight",
     xlab="Mileage per Gallon",ylab="Weight",
     col = mtcars$cyl,pch=16,cex=3)
legend("topright",legend=c(8,6,4),pch=16,cex=3,
       col=c(8,6,4))
```

Here, `pch` is the plotting character; 16 corresponds to a circle, and `cex` is the size of the plotting characters. The full table of plotting characters is here:

What if we want to save a plot? Let's save it as a PDF. Here's how we do it:
```r
pdf("myplot.pdf")
boxplot(mtcars$mpg,col="blue",main="Boxplot for mpg")
dev.off()
```

## Graphics Devices
A graphics device is something where you can make a plot appear When you make a plot in R, it has to be "sent" to a specific graphics device.

- A window on your computer (screen device): quick visualization
- A PDF, PNG, JPEG file (file device) #recommended for documents, paper, presentation

The most common place for a plot to be "sent" is the screen device

- On a Mac the screen device is launched with the quartz()
- On Windows the screen device is launched with windows()
- On Unix/Linux the screen device is launched with x11()
- save graphic to PDF
- save graphic to PNG, JPEG

```r
dev.copy(png,"filename.png") # to save the image to file
dev.off() # to close all the graphical devices
```
