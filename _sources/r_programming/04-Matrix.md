```{admonition} Vector math
:class: dropdown

- R can do a lot of mathematical operations on vectors:

~~~r
a <- 3:7
b <- 20:24
a+b
a>b
a>5
a*b
a/b
~~~

- What if vector lenghts don't match?

~~~r
a<-1:5
b<-1:6
a
b
a+b
~~~

```

```{admonition} Matrices
:class: dropdown

- Vectors are one-dimensional rows of numbers; matrices are 
two-dimensional tables. Like vectors, all elements of a matrix 
must be of the same data type. 

Let's create a matrix of zeros:

~~~r
m <- matrix (0, nrow=3, ncol=4)
m
~~~

- When creating a matrix, you will need to specify number of rows and columns. 
- You can create a matrix from a vector:

~~~r
m <- matrix(1:12,nrow=3,ncol=4)
m <- matrix(1:12,3,4)
m
dim(m)
~~~

- Another way to create a matrix from a vector:

~~~r
m <- 1:12
dim(m) <- c(3,4)
~~~

```


```{admonition} Basic matrix math
:class: dropdown

~~~r
m1 <- matrix(1:9,nrow=3,ncol=3)
m2 <- matrix(rep(10,9),3,3)
m1
m2
m1+m2
m1*m2
m1 %*% m2
~~~

- Some additional matrix functions:

~~~r
# Define a matrix
mr <- matrix(runif(9),3,3)
#Transpose a matrix
t(mr)
#Diagonal elements of a matrix
diag(mr)
#Determinant
det(mr)
#Inverse
solve(mr)
solve(mr) %*% mr
~~~

```


```{admonition} Merging Matrices
:class: dropdown

- Merging matrices by row and column using `rbind` and `cbind`:

~~~r
m 
m2 <- -1:-12
dim(m2) <- c(3,4)
m2
cbind(m,m2)
rbind(m,m2)
~~~

```

<!---
## Factors
Factors are used to represent categorical data
```r
m <- c("John","Mary","John","John","Jeff","Mary")
factor(m)
table(m)
```
-->

```{admonition} Subsetting
:class: dropdown

- Subsetting is extracting elements from 
vectors/matrices/lists. In R, subsetting is 
denoted with square brackets: `[]`

~~~r
str <- c("a", "b","c","d")
str
# Find the subset with index 1 for str:
str[1]
# Find the subset with index 2:4 for str:
str[2:4]
~~~

- You can see that we can use a vector to subset another vector.
- Subsetting is very flexible. You can use a vector of logicals 
to subset another vector:

~~~r
a <- c (1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1)
a
a>2
a[a>2]
~~~

- You can use this method to filer out elements which are `NaNs`:

~~~r
a <- c(1:5,NaN,TRUE)
a
# Find the location of *NaN* value using `is.nan()` function
ind <- is.nan(a)
ind
# Subset with location of *NaN* value
a[ind]
a[is.nan(a)]
# Subset with location of `Not NaN` values using `!`
a[!ind]
~~~

- Subsetting matrices
  - When subsettig a matrix, we use two indices (row and column):

~~~r
m <- matrix(1:12,nrow=3,ncol=4)
m
m[2,3]
m[1,1:3]
~~~

- Extracting a whole row or column: 

~~~r
m[2,]
m[,4]
~~~

```

```{admonition} Lists
:class: dropdown

- In matrices and vectors, all elements belong to the same class. 
A collection of variables from different classes is called a list.

~~~r
str <- "Clemson"
a <- 5
b <- 4L
list1 <- list(str,a,b)
list1
~~~

- Lists are very flexible. A vector, or a matrix, can be 
an element of a list:

~~~r
c <- 6i ^ (-3:3)
d <- 1:10 < 5
list2 <- list(str,a,b,c,d)
list2
~~~

- Subsetting lists
  - Elements of a list can also be extracted by subsetting, 
  using the dollar sign `$`:

~~~r
str <- c("a", "b","c","d")
list1 <- list(l1=str,l2=4:6)
list1
# Use $ to call a variable name
list1$l1[3]
~~~

```


```{admonition} Data Frames
:class: dropdown

- Data frames are used to store tables, where columns 
correspond to a particular variable, and rows correpond to 
a particular observation. 

- Data Frame characteristics:
  - Column name should not be empty
  - Row name should be unique
  - Data can be numeric, integer, character
  - Each column contains same number of data items

~~~r
df <- data.frame(data=sample(12),title=LETTERS[sample(12)])
dim(df)
nrow(df)
ncol(df)
~~~

- There are many readily available data frames in R, for 
example [`iris`](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) data set:

~~~r
data(iris)
dim(iris)
head(iris)
~~~

```


```{admonition} Names of objects in data frames
:class: dropdown

- Using `name()` function:

~~~r
names(iris)
# Change name
names(iris) <- c("a", "b", "c","d","e")
head(iris)

#Change name for particular columns:
names(iris)[4] <- "new_name"
~~~

```


```{admonition} Getting data from data frames
:class: dropdown

- Columns of a data frame could be extracted with `$` 
(as in a list) or with `[]` (as in a matrix).

~~~r
data(mtcars)
head (mtcars)
mpg1 <- mtcars$mpg
mpg2 <- mtcars[,1]
cylinder <- mtcars$cyl
~~~

```

```{admonition} Reading and writing tables
:class: dropdown

- Reading table
  - Data frames can be created by reading from a file (a text file, 
  or a CSV / Excel file). The file can be on a local computer, or online.
  - `read.table`: read table in text format
  - `read.csv`: read table in csv format
  - `read.xlsx`: read table in excel format (require xlsx packages)
  - `readLines`: read lines of a text file
- Writing table
  - In a similar fashion, a data frame can be saved 
  as a text/CSV/Excel file:
  - `write.table`: write table in text format
  - `write.csv`: write table in csv format
  - `write.xlsx`: write table in excel format (require xlsx packages)
  - `writeLines`: write lines of a text file
- In this example, I perform reading 
[online sale data](https://support.spatialkey.com/spatialkey-sample-csv-data/) 
and save the output to current working directory:

~~~r
# Read online csv data
saledata <- read.csv('https://support.spatialkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sacramentorealestatetransactions.csv')
dim(saledata)
names(saledata)

# Save output to csv file
write.csv(saledata,'SaleData.csv')
~~~

- Here, we read a poam from an online text file, and save 
ten lines in the working directory:

~~~r
poem <- readLines("http://lib.ru/SHAKESPEARE/sonnets.txt")
poem[10:20]
writeLines(poem[10:20],"Sonnet1.txt")
~~~

```
