## Classes of objects
In R, there are 5 main classes of objects:
* characters a, b
* numeric: 2.3
* integer: 5 or 5L
* complex: 2+3i #consists of real and imaginary parts
* logical: TRUE/FALSE

```r
str <- "string"
class(str)
a <- 5
class(a)
b <- 4L
class(b)
c <- 1+6i 
class(c)
d <- b < 5
class(d)
```

## Logical operations
Logical operations "and" and "or" are computed with `&&` and `||`:
```r
a<-TRUE
b<-FALSE
a&&b
a||b
```
Logical "not" is computed with !:
```r
!a
!b
a && !b
```


## Numbers
* In R, a number is considered a numeric type:
```r
e <- 5
class(e)
```
* To get an integer, insert `L` as suffix
```r
f <- 5L
class(f)
```
* Special number: `Inf`: infinity
```r
g<-5/0
class(g)
5/0
-5/0
log(0)
```
* `NaN` (Not a Number) specifies an undefined value:
```r
h <- 0/0
h
log(-1)
asin(4)
```
Sometimes, when you are dealing with data, you have missing values. In R, there is a special way to denote missing values: `NA` ("not available"). `NaN` is a special type of `NA`.

## Random Number & seed
Create random numeric numbers using runif
```r
runif(1)
runif(3)
runif(2,10,20)
```

Set the seed of R's random number generator, which is useful for creating simulations or random objects that can be reproduced.
```r
set.seed(1234)
runif(3)
```

Create a sample of random numbers: 
```r
sample(12,5)
sample(12)
sample(letters,4)
```
`sample` returns a set of variables, rather than one variable. Sets of variables of the same type are called vectors.


## Vectors
Vectors are sets of variables of the same class, in a certain order. The simplest, and a very useful, type of a vector is a range of values, specified with a colon:

```r
x <- 1:5
x <- -3:3
```

The same could be accomplished with the `seq` function:

```r
seq (from=1, to=5)
seq (from=1, to=5, by=2)
seq (1, 5, 2)
```

You can also define a vector by combining a bunch of values (`c` stands for "combine"):

```r
str <- c("a", "b", "c")
a   <- c(4, 5.6, 20)
b   <- c("TRUE", "FALSE")
```

To create a vector where all elements have the same value, use the `rep` function (for "repetition"):
```r
x <- rep (3, 5)
```

If a vector is combined from variables of different types, R tries to "coerce" them into the same type. For example, logicals can be coerced into numbers (TRUE becomes 1, and FALSE becomes 0):

```r
c(TRUE, FALSE)
c(TRUE, FALSE, 5)
```

Likewise, numbers can be coerced into characters:

```r
c (5, "a")
```
In this example, everything is ultimately coerced into characters:

```r
str1 <- c("a", "b", TRUE, 5, 4.5)
str1
class(str1)
```

## Explicit Coercion
Convert objects from one class to another, using `as.` function:
```r
a <- 0:5
class(a)
as.numeric(a)
as.logical(a)
as.character(a)
```
How about Nonsensical Coercion?
```r
str <- c("a","b","c")
class(str)
as.numeric(str)
as.logical(str)
as.character(str)
```

## Missing values
In order to detect missing values or bad values (NaN, NA, Inf), we can use these functions:
* is.na() test NA value
* is.nan() test NaN value
* is.infinite() test Inf value
* NaN is NA but the reverse is false
```r
v <- c(TRUE, 6, 1/0,NA, NaN,-6/0)
v
is.na(v)
is.nan(v)
is.infinite(v)
```
