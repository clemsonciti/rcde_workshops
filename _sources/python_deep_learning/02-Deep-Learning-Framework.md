(1) Keras

- Keras is an effective high-level neural network Application Programming Interface (API) written in Python. This open-source neural network library is designed to provide fast experimentation with deep neural networks, and it can run on top of CNTK, TensorFlow, and Theano.
- Keras focuses on being modular, user-friendly, and extensible. It doesn’t handle low-level computations; instead, it hands them off to another library called the Backend.
- Keras was adopted and integrated into TensorFlow in mid-2017. Users can access it via the tf.keras module. However, the Keras library can still operate separately and independently.

(2) Pytorch
- Pytorch is a relatively new deep learning framework based on Lua Torch.
- Developed by Facebook’s AI research group and open-sourced on GitHub in 2017, it’s used for natural language processing applications.
- Pytorch has a reputation for simplicity, ease of use, flexibility, efficient memory usage, and dynamic computational graphs. It also feels native, making coding more manageable and increasing processing speed.
- Strong competitor to Tensorflow

(3) Tensorflow
- TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source deep learning framework developed by Google and released in 2015.
- It is known for documentation and training support, scalable production and deployment options, multiple abstraction levels, and support for different platforms, such as Android.
- TensorFlow is a symbolic math library used for neural networks and is best suited for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It offers multiple abstraction levels for building and training models.

(4) Theano
- Theano used to be one of the more popular deep learning libraries, an open-source project that lets programmers define, evaluate, and optimize mathematical expressions, including multi-dimensional arrays and matrix-valued expressions.
- Theano was developed by the Universite de Montreal in 2007 and is a key foundational library used for deep learning in Python. It’s considered the grandfather of deep learning frameworks and has fallen out of favor by most researchers outside academia.

### Conclusions:
- Keras is the easiest Deep Learning Library API. It is easy to transit from Machine Learning based model
- Tensorflow is the most popular DL library developed by Google. It has the most number of user.
- Pytorch is developed by Facebook and gaining significant attention from users all over the world
