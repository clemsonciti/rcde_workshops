## Brief Introduction to Deep Learning 

### Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning. Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligent

### While Machine Learning utilizes many different algorithm, Deep Learning only focuses on using Artificial Neural Network

### While Machine Learning mostly uses Shallow Neural Network (1 or max 2 hidden layers), Deep Learning tends to use multiple hidden layers between input and output.

## Deep Learning Models
In this workshop we focus on several typical Deep Learning models:

(1) Regular Deep Neural Network

(2) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

(3) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
