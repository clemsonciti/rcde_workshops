## Workshop Description
Machine learning is the science of teaching computers to reproduce the assigned 
procedure without being explicitly programmed. It has been used in many practical 
applications such as self-driving cars, speech recognition, email spam classification. 
It has been widely used not only in engineering (hydroinformatics, bioinformatics, 
genomics, geosciences and remote sensing, mechatronics) but also in economy, health 
sciences and even in real estates industry. This workshop provides an overall 
introduction to machine learning specifically with R programming language which 
utilizes abundance of R statistical packages. Such topics include: (1) Supervised 
learning (regression analysis, distance-based algorithm, regularization algorithm, 
tree-based algorithm, Bayes algorithm, support vector machines, artificial neural 
networks). (2) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction). The 
course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications that can be 
applied in different engineering programs.

## Prerequisite

Prerequisite for the workshop is the **Introduction to Python Programming** workshop.
