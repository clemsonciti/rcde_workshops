    "# Supervised Learning Model Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we evaluate the performance of a machine learning model? There are many different metrics that can be used, depending on the type of problem and the goals of the model. The choice of metric will almost always depend heavily on the type of problem you are trying to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we apply these metrics? We can split our data into a training set and a test set. We train our model on the training set and then evaluate its performance on the test set. If we're tuning hyperparameters, we might use a validation set as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "![train_test](img/tr_ts.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even better than a single train/test split is to use *cross-validation*. In cross-validation, the data is split into K folds, and the model is trained and evaluated K times, each time using a different fold as the test set. This gives us a more robust estimate of the model's performance.\n",

    "### 1. Regression Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "In a regression problem, we are trying to predict a continuous value. Some common metrics for evaluating regression models include:\n",
    "* Mean Squared Error (MSE) - the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values\n",
    "* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) - the square root of the MSE. More interpretable than MSE due to being in the same units as the target variable\n",
    "* Mean Absolute Error (MAE) - the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values\n",
    "* R-squared (R2) - a measure of how much of the variation in the target is captured by your model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a metric used to measure the average squared difference between actual values and predicted values. It is commonly used in regression tasks to quantify the accuracy of a predictive model. Mathematically, MSE is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ n $ is the number of data points, $ y_i $ represents the actual value of the $ i $-th data point, and $ \\hat{y}_i $ is the predicted value of the $ i $-th data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose a model predicts housing prices for four houses as $ \\hat{y} = [250k, 300k, 200k, 400k] $, while the actual prices are $ y = [260k, 310k, 190k, 390k] $. The MSE would be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( (260k - 250k)^2 + (310k - 300k)^2 + (190k - 200k)^2 + (390k - 400k)^2 \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( 10k^2 + 10k^2 + (-10)^2 + (-10)^2 \\right) = 100M $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the MSE for this prediction is 100M, meaning that, on average, the squared error between predicted and actual housing prices is 100M. Notice this is *not* on the scale of dollars, it is on the scale of dollars *squared*.\n",
