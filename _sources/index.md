# Research Computing and Data Workshops

The Research Computing and Data Engagement (RCDE) team has a collection of
workshops that our staff members offer to users of Palmetto. Join us and expand
your knowledge on a wide variety of high-performance computing, research, and
other related topics.

## Schedule

Many of our workshops have a live session offered every semester, while others
are offered on a rotational or as-requested basis.

For information about when live sessions will be offered, see the 
[upcoming live sessions](https://docs.rcd.clemson.edu/training/schedule)

## Certificates

In the past, some of our workshops offered a Certificate of Attendance to our
attendees. At this time, **we are not offering certificates** to workshop
attendees.
