## Workshop Description
Machine learning is the science of teaching computers to reproduce the assigned procedure 
without being explicitly programmed. It has been used in many practical applications such as 
self-driving cars, speech recognition, email spam classification. It has been widely used not 
only in engineering (hydroinformatics, bioinformatics, genomics, geosciences and remote sensing, 
mechatronics) but also in economy, health sciences and even in real estates industry. This workshop 
provides an overall introduction to machine learning specifically with R programming language which 
utilizes abundance of R statistical packages. Such topics include: (1) Supervised learning (regression 
analysis, distance-based algorithm, regularization algorithm, tree-based algorithm, Bayes algorithm, 
support vector machines, artificial neural networks). (2) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality 
reduction). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications that can be 
applied in different engineering programs.



## Prerequisites

Pre-requisite for the course is **Introduction to R programming**, offered by CITI team.
