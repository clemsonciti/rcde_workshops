Linux is a family of free and open-source operating systems based on the kernel created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. A kenel is software that coordinates/interfaces the computer's hardware and other sofware. An operating system based on Linux is called a **distro** or distribution.

Every entry on the [Top 500](https://top500.org) runs Linux. The Palmetto cluster is running a Linux distro called [Rocky Linux 8](https://rockylinux.org).

This workshop will teach you how to use the Linux command line interface or **CLI**. For this purpose, we will use a *terminal* software, such as MobaXTerm or Putty (on Windows machines) or Terminal (on Mac and Linux machines).

The terminal is a wrapper program that provides text-only input and output from the **shell**. The **shell** is a program that will allow us to interact directly with the operating system kernel. There are many different shells, but the most common (and the default on Palmetto) is **Bash**. Bash provides it's own *stripting language* which allows us to run commands automatically.
 
```{note}
Linux is case-sensitive and typo-sensitive. 
Commands need to be entered directly as shown; it is important to use the right case (upper or lower), to use spaces when they are needed, and not to use spaces when they are not needed.
