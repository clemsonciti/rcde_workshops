## Workshop Description
This workshop series introduces the essential concepts in deep learning and walks through the common steps in a deep learning workflow from data loading and preprocessing to training and model evaluation. Throughout the sessions, students participate in writing and executing simple deep learning programs using Pytorch -- a popular Python library for developing, training, and deploying deep learning models.

## Prerequisites
All students should have a Palmetto Cluster account. If you do not already have an account, you can visit our [getting started page](https://docs.rcd.clemson.edu/palmetto/starting). Students should be familiar with the Python programming language. This requirement could be fulfilled by personal projects, coursework, or completion of the Introduction to [Python Programming workshop series](https://clemsonciti.github.io/rcde_workshops/python_programming/00-index.html). Experience in numeric computing with the numpy library is helpful but not required.
