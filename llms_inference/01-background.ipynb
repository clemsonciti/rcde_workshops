    "# Running LLMs on Palmetto\n",

    "## Instructor\n",
    "- **Instructor**: Carl Ehrett\n",
    "- **Office**: 2105 Barre Hall, Clemson University\n",
    "- **Email**: cehrett AT clemson DOT edu\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Description\n",
    "This workshop series introduces essential concepts related to LLMs and works through the common steps in an LLM inference workflow. This workshop focuses on efficiently running LLMs, rather than on constructing, training or fine-tuning them. Throughout the sessions, students will learn how to use the Hugging Face Transformers library to run LLMs on the Palmetto Cluster. The workshop will also cover how to use the Palmetto Cluster to run LLMs on large datasets and how to use the Palmetto Cluster to run LLMs on multiple GPUs and multiple nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "* **All workshop participants should have a Palmetto Cluster account.** If you do not already have an account, you can visit our [getting started page](https://docs.rcd.clemson.edu/palmetto/starting).\n",
    "* **Participants should be familiar with the Python programming language.** This requirement could be fulfilled by personal projects, coursework, or completion of the Introduction to [Python Programming workshop series](https://clemsonciti.github.io/rcde_workshops/python_programming/00-index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing Workshop Files\n",
    "You can download the notebooks and their contents as follows.\n",
    "In the terminal, create or navigate to an empty folder. Run the following command: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clemsonciti/rcde_workshops/master/llms_inference/download.sh`\n",
    "This copies to your drivespace a script `download.sh` that, when run, will copy the full workshop files to your drivespace. So now that you have that script, run the command: `bash download.sh`. You should now have a folder, `llms_inference`, which contains the workshop files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment\n",
    "To run the code in this workshop, you will need a python environment with the appropriate libraries installed. You can create such an environment as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the directory where the workshop contents are stored. Submit the script `create_env.sh` as a job, by running the command `sbatch create_env.sh`. This will create a conda environment named `LLMsInferenceWorkshop`. (This will take a while; up to 60 minutes.) You can then use that environment as the Jupyter kernel to run the notebooks in this environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if you'd rather run the script interactively: in the terminal (and not in JupyterLab), get an interactive session using `salloc --mem=12GB --time=01:30:00`. In the directory where the workshop contents are stored, run `bash create_env.sh`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hugging Face Hub\n",
    "In order to use the code in the Workshop notebooks, you will need a Hugging Face account. You can create one [here](https://huggingface.co/join)."

    "\n",
    "#### Direct Download\n",
    "- Many models are available for direct download from their creators' websites or repositories.\n",
    "- Use `wget` or `curl` to fetch model files directly into your HPC environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hugging Face Hub\n",
    "- The Hugging Face Hub is a popular platform for accessing pre-trained models, datasets, and other ML resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is the Hugging Face Hub?\n",
    "- A community-driven platform with thousands of pre-trained models for NLP, computer vision, and more.\n",
    "- Provides tools for easy integration with Python scripts and libraries like `transformers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Setting Up Your Hugging Face Account\n",
    "1. Visit [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/) and create an account.\n",
    "2. Generate a personal access token:\n",
    "   - Go to **Settings** > **Access Tokens**.\n",
    "   - Create a new token with the necessary permissions for downloading models.\n",
    "3. Log in to the Hugging Face CLI to store your token:\n",
    "   - Run the following command after activating your `LLMsInferenceWorkshop` environment:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     huggingface-cli login\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Paste your access token when prompted.\n",
    "   - The token will be saved in `~/.huggingface/token`, allowing persistent access without needing to re-enter it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Setting the Cache Directory\n",
    "- To avoid storing large models in your home directory, configure a cache directory on your scratch space:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  export HF_HOME=/scratch/username/huggingface\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Add this line to your .bashrc or .bash_profile to make it persistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Downloading models\n",
    "- Now open a **new** terminal window and re-activate your environment.\n",
    "- To download a model, run the command\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  huggingface-cli download [model_name]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- For these notebooks, you will need to download `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct`, `Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct`, `Equall/Saul-Instruct-v1` and `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B`. "

We will not focus on the mathematical details of these models or how they work at a fundamental level. Instead, we will focus on how to use pre-trained LLMs to generate text efficiently on Palmetto. Everything we will discuss here also extends to using Multimodal LLMs on Palmetto as well.\n",

    "How is using an LLM on the Cluster different from using a web interface like ChatGPT? How is it different from using an LLM through an API like OpenAI's API?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Control:** Aside from control over the system prompt, you have control over the model itself. You can choose which model to use. This is again **crucial for reproducibility**. Third-party services like Anthropic, Google and OpenAI can and do change or take away models without warning. This can undermine your research. \n",
    "2. **Cost:** Since you all already have access to the Cluster, you can run LLMs on the Cluster for free. This is not the case with third-party services.\n",
    "3. **Privacy:** When running LLMs on the Cluster, your data never need leave the Cluster. This is not the case with third-party services.\n",
    "4. **Speed:** The Cluster is a powerful computing resource. You can run LLMs on the Cluster much faster than you can on your own computer. This is especially true if you use a GPU on the Cluster, and if you batch your data.\n",
    "5. **Not persistent server:** While you can run LLM inference on the Palmetto Cluster, the Cluster does not support hosting a persistent, externally accessible service for real-time LLM interaction, like ChatGPT. HPC systems like the Cluster are optimized for batch processing and resource-intensive jobs, not for real-time interaction, especially with external users.\n"

    "\n",

    "That just means that the mathematical object that is the model is composed of that many numbers. Each such number is typically represented by a 16-bit floating point number, which is 2 bytes. So, a 100-billion-parameter model would be about 200 GB in size. To run that model, it's not enough to store that on your SSD or HDD; you need to load it into memory -- preferably GPU memory! *Nobody's laptop has that much memory.*\n",
    "\n",

    "Quantization represents the model parameters with fewer bits than the 16-bit floating point numbers that are typically used. This can reduce the size of the model by a factor of 2, 4, or more. It can also speed up the model. It comes at a cost, however: quantization can reduce the performance of the model."
