# Collaboration and Conflicts

In order to collaborate on a Git repository, you will need a remote server that
multiple users can connect to. For example, the RCD GitLab server we mentioned
previously.

Once you have set up a repository on the remote server, you can use commands on
your local computer to interact with it.
